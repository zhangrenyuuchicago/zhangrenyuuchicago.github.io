I am a research engineer in KLA. We develop deep learning based wafer defect detection systems.

I obtained my PhD deploma from the University of Chicago. My primary research interest lies broadly in the intersection between healthcare and machine learning. My advisor is [Robert L. Grossman](https://rgrossman.com/about.html) and I also work closely with [Aly A. Khan](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aakhan/) and [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/). 

I got my bachelor degree from Shandong University and master degree from the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
